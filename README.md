# List of tasks:

Using the Jackson library, write a Java program that parses a JSON file (books.json) and saves the data to a Java collection.

Convert the data from this collection to XML using the JAXB library. Save the resulting XML to a file.

Using any parser (DOM, SAX, StAX), parse the data in a Java application and output to the console information about the book with the largest number of pages.
